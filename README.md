# Excel ðŸ“Š

This repo contains excel workbooks with various formulas & tools used to manipulate data.<br>
These are used to find patterns and identify trends from raw data.<br>

There is also a project task which involved creating a dashboard in excel looking into bike sales data.<br>
Before creating a dashboard, I cleaned the data to make it easier to work with.<br> 
I:<br>
-checked for and removed 26 duplicates<br>
-found and replaced single letters for words that are better understood<br>
-changed the income column data type to currency and removed unnecessary decimal places<br>
-Used an IFS statement to create an age bracket column grouping ages together<br>
